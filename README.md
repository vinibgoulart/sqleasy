```

After that, you can start a chat using POST `/ai/prompt`:

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/ai/prompt -d '{"prompt": "What are the duplicated users?"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

- Be clear and concise when asking questions.
- In complex queries, you can help the AI by providing more context.
